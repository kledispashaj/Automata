Non-deterministic finite automata(NFA) is a finite automata where for some cases when a specific input is given to the current state, the machine goes to multiple states or more than 1 states. It can contain Îµ move(epsilon-NFA).

On the other hand, in DFA, when a specific input is given to the current state, the machine goes to only one state. DFA has only one move on a given input symbol.
